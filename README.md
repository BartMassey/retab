# retab: detab or entab textfiles
Bart Massey 2016

This Python program either "detabs" (replaces tabs with
spaces) or "entabs" (replaces spaces with tabs) textfiles.

The arguments need to be documented, but currently
aren't. Caveat Emptor.

There's a `test.sh` with very few tests in it. Will be
silent if tests pass.
